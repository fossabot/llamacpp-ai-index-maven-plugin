### Changed
- Switched runtime dependency to `net.ladenthin:llama` 5.0.0 (official Maven Central release).
- CI: added `startgate` abort-window environment before publish pipeline.
- CI: separated snapshot and release publish paths; added `check-snapshot` / `check-tag` gate jobs.
- CI: bumped `softprops/action-gh-release` v2 → v3 (Node 24 compatibility).
- CI: added JaCoCo coverage reporting with Coveralls and Codecov integration.
- README: grouped badges by category (Build / Coverage / Package / License / Community); added Maven Central dependency section.

### Fixed
- CI: quoted gate job names to avoid YAML colon-in-scalar parsing error.
- CI: use `GITHUB_TOKEN` for Coveralls `github-token` parameter instead of `COVERALLS_TOKEN`.
